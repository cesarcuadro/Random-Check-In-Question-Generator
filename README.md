Rule #1 make Austin and Elyse like it 

General Structure
Heading: Random Check in Question Generator 

We are going to need some space to generate the question into

Two buttons, one to generate a check in question, and another to generate a checkout question

We are going to need a database of questions

Random number generator (math.floor) for the question 

Design the background to be eye-catching (CSS)

Have some mascot asking the questions to bring life to the project 

After the question is asked, ask the user if they liked the question or not 
    This will determine how popular it is (possibly making the question come up more often or not)

Let users request to have their questions added to the database
